This repository demonstrates an uncommon Kotlin bug related to the `removeIf()` function's behavior on different collection types.  While `removeIf()` works predictably with `MutableList` and `MutableSet`, using it with `MutableMap` might produce unexpected results if not handled carefully.  The code showcases this and provides a solution. Please see the `bug.kt` and `bugSolution.kt` files for details.
