The issue lies in how `removeIf()` interacts with the iterators of different collection types.  Modifying the collection during iteration can lead to unpredictable behavior.  For maps, directly iterating over the keySet and removing elements is a safer approach. 

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val map = mutableMapOf(1 to "one", 2 to "two", 3 to "three", 4 to "four", 5 to "five")
    val keysToRemove = map.keys.filter { it % 2 == 0 }
    keysToRemove.forEach { map.remove(it) }
    println(map) // Output: {1=one, 3=three, 5=five}
}
```
This solution iterates over a copy of the keys to be removed, preventing modification during iteration and ensuring correct behavior.
